Urgent Issue with SPC Zhang
Good morning Mrs Nacy,
My name is Qing Zhang who has been lived in Davis for three years.  Recently I have an urgent issue need your help and this is my last resort. 
I am the Mavni solider who joined the US Army Reserve through Mavni (Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest ) in 2015.  I speaks Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin and English, Graduated from UC Davis, UC Berkeley, University of Iowa, Golden State University, will go to Stanford University in 2020 for my Mechanical Engineering Management study.  Currently I drilled with my Unit 1397th DDSB every month as a good standing performance for three years  
There is a situation that Pentagon required every Mavni Soldiers need to finish their background checking started as 2016.  I pass my background check however still got an unfavorable Military Service Suitability Recommendation(MSSR) related to my finance(parents support me to go to school), foreign ties(wife is Chinese) and honesty issues(if  I have honesty issue, then I would not pass my single scope background investigation ).  However, all these issues have been mentioned in my Single Scope Background Investigation Report and the FBI agents concluded me as “No Issues.” And my unit commander CPT Miller and COL Guevarra already support me to submit a mitigation package to the Army G1 in OCT 13th 2018.  Until now I still not heard anything back from them. 
I am here to ask your help to ask Army G1 to reconsider my case or grant me a wavier (based on the Army 3rd Dec 2018 Memorandum) for my military service suitability to allow me to go to basic training this summer before I am out of status(March 12th 2019).   I have been serve my unit for more than three years with a good performance and all my peers from my unit told me that I might be the one who finished the military contract without going to Basic Training. All the evidence from my security manager, my investigator and my chain of commander support me I am a good solider and I want to go to basic.
I just had a baby in Sep 2018 in Davis and my current deferred action status will expired in 12th March 2019(less than 10 days) which means if I did not hear anything back from the Army, I will be out of status and I do not know what I should do to support my family. I also attached the successful case before under other congressman’s help; the Mavni solder can overturn his unfavorable MSSD and go to basic now.   
The Army G1 already has my mitigation packages since last year but they did not take any action until now.  I also can send you my package to you for reviewing as well. 
Again, thank you so much for your help,
SPC Zhang
